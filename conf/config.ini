# For example, if the server runs at `http://timegate.example.com` and all original resources begin with `http://example.com/res/{resource ID}`,
# then setting `base_uri = http://example.com/res/` will allow short requests such `http://timegate.example.com/{resource ID}`

# Default true

# cache_refresh_time
# Time in seconds, for which it is assumed that a TimeMap didn't change. Any TimeGate request for a datetime past this period (or any TimeMap request past this period) will trigger a refresh of the cached value.
